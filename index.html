        That is a good quesiton in itself.

        I had woken up, only to come to find out none of my "friends" are online on Xbox playing APEX. Any time I play with them we do get close but the way we finish is just not there, and I think they've caught on to that.

        This here is a nice snippet story.
        <br>
        Talking about when Scottie was Pippen I was over at the college hanging with the boys from the swim team. One of them had challenged me to a basketball game, come to find out all of the guys wanted in on the game we were about to have. In order to cure their need for a game we had invited them over to play and had a little fun 3v3. Moral of the story, Ultra Instinct is real and I whooped everyone.
